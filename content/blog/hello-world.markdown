Hi, and welcome to the Spectacle Labs blog!  Spectacle Labs is a super new open-source hardware startup based in snowy [Leicester](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester). Our first product, which is currently working it's way through prototyping, will involve microcontrollers, bleeping sounds, and code.

Over the next couple of months you can expect to hear plenty more about what we're working on, along with updates following the joy and the heartbreak of embedded software development, techy posts about audio processing which overuse the word 'aliasing', and thoughts on how computing education can be made far more awesome.  Thanks for reading, and please don't hesitate to get in touch,either through the comments or by [email](mailto:hi@spectaclelabs.org).
