![First Prototype](/media/images/blog/2013-04-09-prototype.png)

The image above is super exciting - it's the first 3D render of the first prototype of our first board.  All the routing is finally finished, so it's time to find someone to knock up a couple of boards.  As soon as they get here I'll put some images up and there will be videos of a working board with blinking lights Real Soon Now.
