When Spectacle Labs makes its first million, I will be able to do two important things.  One is afford to eat less lentils, and the other is to put some cheques in the post to the awesome open-source projects which are helping make Spectacle Labs a reality.  Sadly whilst I'm still living on lentils and cups of tea the best I can manage is a a series of blog posts shouting about why the projects are so great.

First up is [Dangerous Prototypes'](http://dangerousprototypes.com/) [Sick of Beige](http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Sick_of_Beige_standard_PCB_sizes_v1.0), described by Ian from DP in the video above.  Now standards are kind of dull right?  And I'm not going to convince anyone that the size of circuit boards is a fascinating topic of conversation.  So why is a PCB sizing standard in the list of stuff we love?  Three big reasons:

1. Blank slates are bad: There is something incredibly dispiriting about seeing a whole bunch of components which need laying out.  Having a fixed PCB size to aim at somehow makes the whole thing seem much more achievable.
2. Project boxes are bad: Seriously, go to website of any enclosure manufacturer.  Feeling inspired to make something?  Thought not.
3. Making things fit in project boxes is bad: The board is too big.  Or too small.  You need to drill holes for standoffs.  Or get something custom made.  Putting something in a box has never been so difficult.

For those three reasons we love Sick of Beige, and until I develop a competing standard it will be used in everything we make.
